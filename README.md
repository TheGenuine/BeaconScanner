BeaconScanner
============

The Android counter part to the BLE_Arduino project.
This project as well as the BLE_Ardunio project are part of a Master dissertation
developing an approcach for a energy efficient Body Area Netowork.
This is tried to be achived by situation and context adaptive behavior.

This app does not do too much it is ment as a demonstration element only.
It searches and connects to an available Bluetooth low energy device and listens to updates for specific characterists.
It also can send changes to characteristics that represent connection interval, slave latency, sampling rate and 
buffer limit.
